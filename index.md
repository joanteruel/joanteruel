## Bio

My full name is Jacob Sparks Lodwick. I am a serial entrepreneur &amp; my current focus is [Keezy](//keezy.net/), a member of the [Elepath](//elepath.com/) family. I was born and grew up in Baltimore, MD. I live in Brooklyn.

## Stuff I Wrote

[The Shit To Get](/tstg.html) (things worth buying)

[An acquisition is always a failure](http://pando.com/2013/04/02/an-acquisition-is-always-a-failure/) (My thoughts on selling companies. I didn't write the headline.)

[Tulum Tips][4] (travel tips for a beach town in Mexico)

## Productivity Tools

I've build two productivity tools which I use constantly and update from time to time. There are [NowDoThis][5], a task manager that focuses you on one thing at a time, and [Standards][6], a system for managing your habits on a weekly basis.
